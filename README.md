🚀 Live demo of this project []()



## 💻 Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>
By now you've used many different gems with Rails and this exercise will have you connect previous knowledge with new knowledge as you get a chance to use Webpack with jsbundling-rails gem.

### Setup <a name="setup"></a>

1. Ensure you have Ruby 3.2.2 at least, installed on your system. You can check your Ruby version in the terminal by running:

```
ruby -v
```

If Ruby is not installed, you can download and install it from the official Ruby website.

2. To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.
Choose the directory on your local machine where you want to copy project. For example:
```
cd /home/user/name-of-your-directory
```

Clone the project using one of the options.

Using SSH-key:
```
git clone git@github.com:mrcbq/ruby-react-app.git
```

Using HTTPS:

```
git clone https://github.com/mrcbq/ruby-react-app
```
You can also create the new directory just adding the name of it in the end of command. For example:

```
git clone https://github.com/mrcbq/ruby-react-app
```
### Installation <a name="install"></a>

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory where you have cloned or downloaded the ruby-react App repository.

3. Run the following command to install any required dependencies (in this case, we assume there are no external dependencies, so this step may not be needed):

```
bundle install
```

### Usage <a name="usage"></a>

1. Once the setup is complete, ensure you are still in the directory containing the ruby-react App files.

2. To run the app, execute the following command:

```
./bin/dev
```

3.If you have future features like GUI or interactive mode, follow the specific instructions provided for those features in the app's documentation.

### Tests <a name="tests"></a>

To run the tests ensure you are in the directory containing the test files.

1. Run the tests using the following command:

```
rspec
```

3. All tests should pass without any errors or failures, ensuring that the code and its methods are functioning correctly.
